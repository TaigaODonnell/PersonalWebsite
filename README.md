# Personal Portfolio Website

By Taiga O'Donnell

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website that I made for my own use. It is built using HTML and CSS and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is 80% responsive and has a simple design.

I mostly followed a tutorial on how to make a website from scratch since I know nothing about web development. I never used HTML or CSS before so I learned a good amount just from watching and following the tutorial.
